Employee Management Systems (EMS) are a vital part of  businesses that aim to streamline its operations, increase efficiency, and reduce manual power. 
It should be able to provide features for employee tracking, timesheet management, payroll calculation, performance evaluation, and many more. 
However, most existing EMS solutions are either too costly or lack customization, which hinders the small to medium-sized enterprises from adopting them.
They can't afford expensive Employee Management Systems because they're either too costly or not flexible enough. Our project "PulseHR" creates a cheap and adaptable EMS. It helps small and medium-sized businesses manage their staff better, making their work smoother and helping them grow.
