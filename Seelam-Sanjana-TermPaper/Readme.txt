This term paper examines the difficulties users encounter
when trying to manage hidden photos in Android gallery apps
and suggests a user-centric solution to overcome current con-
straints. The goal of the research is to provide a safe and well-
organized solution for hidden photo collections by utilising
the built-in features of Android, particularly the Secure Folder
functionality on Android devices (like Samsung) and the
organisational powers of Google Photos. The study assesses
a number of techniques, such as file managers, cloud storage,
password-protected apps, third-party apps, and encryption
