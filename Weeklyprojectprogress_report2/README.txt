In this week of our PulseHR Employee Management System project, we transitioned from project initiation to an intensive development phase. The main objective was to establish a strong foundation, which included creating a dedicated Node.js backend for server-side logic, API development, and data processing. So, we integrated the system with a MySQL database to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

A notable accomplishment was the successful setup of Express RESTful APIs. These APIs act as a crucial link between the front-end and back-end, facilitating smooth data transactions. The focus on building RESTful APIs is vital for implementing fundamental CRUD operations, laying the groundwork for comprehensive management of employee data.

Collaborative efforts were dedicated to seamlessly integrating the backend and database components. This progress sets the stage for subsequent development phases, highlighting the importance of a well-connected and functional Employee Management System. Looking ahead, our focus remains on refining these foundational elements in preparation for implementing additional features in the coming weeks.
