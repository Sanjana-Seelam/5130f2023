As part of the PulseHR Employee Management System project, our team concentrated on project start throughout the first phase. By building a development environment and including necessary technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we created the fundamental framework. Our primary objectives were to create an intuitive and adaptable user interface that would facilitate seamless navigation. We also worked on defining the database structure, configuring the server, creating the basis for the backend, and creating connections for data retrieval and storage. The smooth functioning of the entire system depended on this foundational work.This could be subjective to initial idea and could differ gradually with effective progress and input of our team.
