Significant progress was made in the fourth week of backend development for the PulseHR Employee Management System, especially in improving backend logic and fortifying security measures. During this phase, improving the backend codebase's efficiency and scalability was our main priority. One of the main focuses of our work was to strengthen system security by putting strict controls in place, with a focus on safe user authentication procedures and data encryption. In the future, we want to improve system performance, add more features for user authentication, and do extensive testing to make sure the system is reliable and resilient. In addition, as part of our quest for backend excellence, we investigated the application of Spring Boot, taking advantage of its potential to optimise backend processes and boost system performance.
